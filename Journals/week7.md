# Learning Activities & Resources
This week I learnt about fundamentals of PHP. We were introduced to:
* How PHP works,
* Some of the keywords in PHP,
* PHP file/folder structure and
* Database in PHP using sqlite

I also liaised with my group members on how best to go about our project, and how to divide the tasks.

# Estimated Hours
I spent a total of about 6 hours of my own time this week on this subject. On Friday, the next day after class, I spent an hour working on setting up my journal and practising some PHP. I spent two additional hours on Saturday, the next day, with my group members in order to continue with our project tasks, by dividing out the works and getting more familiar with GitHub. The following Wednesday, I spent 3 hours working on my PHP project and completing this journal.

# Content Insights
This week's content introduced me to PHP. Based on the lesson content, I was able to achieve the following, as seen in this [commit](https://github.com/onegeniuslykdat/sample-cp5637-theadviceshop/commit/c585fd0f92746c295e71962c48bb3af31733d84c):
* Use the echo function to display different HTML elements
![The use of echo](images/echo.png)
* Use if/else for decisions statements
 ![The use of if-else](images/ifElse.png) 
* Use foreach loop on an array to show repitition
![The use of for-each](images/forEach.png)
* Create and call functions with parameters
![The use of functions](images/functions.png)
* Make use of the include function to add the common header and footer onto the two new pages that I created
![The use of include](images/include.png)

For our group work, I along with my group members had a meeting on Saturday. During this meeting, we put what we had learnt into practice by:
* Dividing our tasks, as seen on our [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/8iJMbw7E/cp5637-group-2-project-work))
* Setting up our version control system, we structured our project GitHub repository, with each of us having a branch. We then created [Pull Requests (PR)s](https://github.com/onegeniuslykdat/CP5637_GROUP2_STUDETBOARDWEBSITE/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed) in order to merge the changes for our site.md, theme.md, readme.md and deployment.md files.

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights
This week, I was able to achieve the following as related to employability and career insights:
* Create my own fork of the PHP Github repo, as seen [here](https://github.com/onegeniuslykdat/sample-cp5637-theadviceshop)
* Clone the repo onto my local PC
* Make some modifications; these include creating a separate and more improved login page, creating two functions, redesigning the header and footer sections***
* Commit my changes to my PC and push to my online fork

I found setting up and getting started with PHP very simple. The syntax of php, however, seems a bit tricky with the '<?php ?>' tag in the html files. Overall,, I thoroughly enjoyed putting the knowledge gained in class into practice in my php project and I can say that I now have a fair understanding how to create a simple php website. The meeting with my group members was also very productive, as we completely achieved our goal to divide the tasks required, based on the content provided.
