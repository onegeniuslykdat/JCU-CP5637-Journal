# Week 10
Monday, 05-Aug-2024 to Saturday, 10-Aug-2024

# Learning Activities & Resources
This week I learnt about Security, especially as it relates to Content Management Systems. We looked at:
* The need for security measures on CMS​
* Installations and maintenance considerations​
* How to make a WordPress site more secure than the default installation​

I learnt about the type and frequency of website hacking occuring globally, as seen [here](https://patchstack.com/articles/website-hacking-statistics/). I also learnt about the number of vulnerabilities for different versions of WordPress, as seen [here](https://www.wpwhitesecurity.com/wordpress-security-news-updates/statistics-70-percent-wordpress-installations-vulnerable/).
​
# Estimated Hours
I spent a total of about 4 hours of my own time this week on this subject. On Friday, I spent 2 hours with my team members working on our project presentation video. On Saturday, I spent 2 hours working on this journal.

# Content Insights
This week's content introduced security in CMS and websites in general. I understood why security is very important and [the most common website attacks](https://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/most-common-website-security-attacks-and-how-to-protect-yourself). I understood that the general overall solutions to security issues are:
* Limiting access : Reduce possible entry points available to a malicious person​
* Containment: Minimise the amount of damage that can be done in the event that it is compromised​
* Preparation and knowledge: Keep backups and know the state of your website installation at regular intervals; have a backup and recovery plan​
* Trusted Sources​: Do not get plugins/themes from untrusted sources; ​only use official repositories or well known companies​

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights
This week, I was able to achieve the following as related to employability and career insights:
* Ensure that WordPress versions are up-to-date so as to have the latest vulnerability fixes and patches.
* Change table prefix from the default ***wp_*** to something else, in order to prevent sql injection attacks
* Install ***iThemes Security*** plugin to help manage security issues
* Use the correct file permissions, rather than just defining full access
* Turn off ***PHP error reporting*** for live sites
* Edit ***.htaccess*** for improved security

Although I generally do not find security very interesting, I found these tips for improving security (on WordPress sites) very helpful. In working with WordPress in the future, I would definitely ensure that I apply some of these insights. 

Finally, these past 10 weeks have really *opened my eyes* about CMS and I have enjoyed working on these tasks.
