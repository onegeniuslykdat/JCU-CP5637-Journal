I also had discussions with my course mates and asked them the following questions, so as to form a group:
* What are your strengths?
* What are your weaknesses?
* What is your most frequesnt mode of communication?

# Estimated Hours
I spent a total of about 5 hours of my own time this week on this subject. On Saturday, I did about an hour of study. The following week, I spent 2 hours each, on Monday and Wednesday working on setting up my [start up wordpress website](https://wordpresssfnstartup.cloudaccess.host/) and also creating my journal. Also, on Wednesday, I spent time completing this journal.

# Content Insights
This week's content introduced Wordpress and also team communiction, as we were introduced to setting a wordpress site and also talking to our class mates to recognize their group qualities. Similar to Joomla, Wordpress also has the option of downloading to your PC, or launching a site online.

We were also introduced to virtual environments such as Scotchbox/Vagrant. These environments help software develoipment teams to quickly setup projects with the correct configurations. Vagrant is a tool for building and distributing development environments. Scotch Box on the other hand, is a pre-configured Vagrant Box with a full array of LAMP Stack features to get you up and running with Vagrant in no time.

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Creating the Wordpress website for my startup was new to me, as I had never done it before. After my experience last week with Joomla, I found this a bit easier to setup. However, editing the site seemed more complex than Joomal's. I started looking at the [LinkedIn Learning WordPress Course](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/wordpress-essential-training-22616273/getting-started-with-wordpress?u=2223545) and it proved very helpful. Overall, this process was somewhat simple to setup, but a bit tidious to customize the site. I intend to watch more videos and study more about it.
