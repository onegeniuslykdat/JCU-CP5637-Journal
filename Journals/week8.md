# Week 8
Monday, 22-Jul-2024 to Saturday, 27-Jul-2024

# **Learning Experiment**

# Observation
My learning has been quite steep, so far, in this course.
I have had to engage in practicals every week. I have also had to commit an average of about 5hours for study, practicals or sometimes, group meetings.
I knew next to nothing about Content Management Systems (CMS)s and PHP. However, 8 weeks into the course, I can say that I have good knowledge of these concepts.

# Hypothesis
My CMS along with my PHP skills have been developed to the industry standard levels due to expansive knowledge, weekly practicals and assignments.

*Practice makes perfect!*

# Prediction
I will be able to create a website using a CMS such as [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) or [Joomla](https://www.joomla.org/). I will also be able to setup a PHP web application and enhance it with functionalities.

# Experiment
I was asked to create two websites in Assessment 1 using the two aformentioned CMSs. I was also asked to setup and work with a PHP web application.

# Results
I was able to create the following websites using CMS:
* [Joomla CMS site](https://sfnstartup.cloudaccess.host/index.php)
* [WordPress CMS site](https://wordpresssfnstartup.cloudaccess.host/)

In the practical [last week](week7.md), I also demostrated how I worked with the PHP sample application provided. Finally, in addition to CMS and PHP, I have also greatly improved my git and markdown skills by consistently creating these journals on GitHub usign .md files.

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights
My learning in this course has given me the following insights into CMS and PHP:

* CMS are a very quick way for organizations especially, to setup a website with lots of functionality. Such organizations might need websites for shopping, event management, holiday destinations management, etc. There would definitely be a plugin to help achieve these.
* PHP is a very easy to setup and use programming language for web applications. It easily integrates its backend php files with html pages.

I have thoroughly enjoyed putting my classroom knowledge into practice throughout this course.
